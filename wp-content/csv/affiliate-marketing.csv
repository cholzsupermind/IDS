Smart Links are compatible with not only the Web 3.0, but also the Web 2.0 as everyone on the net already utilizes/shares links. The Smart Link natively tracks who a link has been shared with and, if a link leads to a revenue-driving action, every sharer gets a share of the pie. 2key Network is democratizing distribution of value by enhancing something people already do: share links. To support network demands, 2key is built on its own second-layer Ethereum solution that crushes the blockchain trilemma.",
